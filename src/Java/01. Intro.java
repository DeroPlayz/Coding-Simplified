package Java;
// Welcome to Java. Java is a verbose language, meaning there's a lot of typing, even for small tasks.
// First off, comments. These allow you to have lines not ran with the code.
// I'm currently using them to write this tutorial in the file itself.
// It only covers one line, and will make everything after it a comment.
// To make one, simply type two forward slashes.

class Intro{// Every Java file has a class, which needs to match the file name. All your code goes inside this.
    public static void Main(String[] args) {// This is a method. It basically tells your program how to do something
    // and says "remember this."
    // So whenever you call it, it says "Oh!" and runs that code.
    // Calling your method "main" makes it, you guessed it, a ✨Main Method!✨
    // Whenever you tell your program to run, it runs the Main Method.
    // Now, you don't need to know what this means, but just remember, "public static void main(String[] args)"
    // This is how you will always declare your Main Method. You can also type psvm and hit tab if you're using VSCode.
