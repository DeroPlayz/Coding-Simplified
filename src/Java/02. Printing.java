        // Welcome to your first Java lesson! Today, you're learning ✨printing to the console.✨
        // Printing to the console is easy, no matter your skill level.
        // It's as simmple as doing:
        // System.out.println("Hi, Future Coder!");
        // Uncomment the line above this one and run it.
        // There's also:
        // System.out.print("Hello again!");
        // The difference between these is a what we call a newline, or linebreak.
        // If you print something with System.out.println, with the ln on the end of it, the next time you print something,
        // it'll appear on the line below.
        {
            // System.out.println("H");
            // System.out.println("i");
        }
        // Run that code. See how the i was on the next line? Well, sometimes you will want to stay on the same line.
        // That's when we use the other version, system.out.println();
        // Remove the 'ln' from the line that prints the H, then run it again.

        // See how it printed a "secret" message now?
        // Congrats! Now, you know how to print text in Java.
