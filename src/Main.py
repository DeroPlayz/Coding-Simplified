# Welcome to Python!
# Let's start with syntax. This is like the grammar for a coding language.
# Different things have different rules.
# For example, to declare a variable in Python, you do:
let Python = "Python"
# 'let' tells the program you're about to name something. The next thing you type is the name of the variable.
# So if you want to print it, you do:
print(Python)
# Then, the '=' tells the program you're gonna assign the value of the variable.
# So, run this file, and see what it does!
