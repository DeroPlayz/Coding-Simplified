# Welcome to Python!
# Let's start with syntax. This is like the grammar for a coding language.
# Different things have different rules.
# For example, to declare a variable in Python, you do:
Python = "Python"
# Since you didn't start with a known-keyword (we'll come back to these), the program knows you're about to name something.
# Then, the '=' tells the program you're gonna assign the value of the variable.
# So if you want to print it, you do:
print(Python);
# So, run this file, and see what it does!
# It gave you an error, right? That's because, unlike most coding languages, you don't put a ';' on the end of the line.
# You just end the line. Could you fix that? Thanks!
# Also, all this (presumably) green text is like this because it's a comment. Comments are ignored when your code runs, 
# so you can put whatever you want in them.
# Next, 'print'. It's one of those special keywords I mentioned earlier.
