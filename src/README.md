# Welcome to Coding Simplified!
I started this silly little repository for all the people out there who are too lazy to read documentation or watch in-depth tutorials!

# 1. Choosing an editor
I reccomend you use Visual Studio Code. It's a very well made editor with a huge extension ecosystem, allowing you to extend its capabilities, and can help you fix autofix errors and just provide general shortcuts, but don't get <em>too</em> reliant on them. You can download it for your system [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). It should be clear which one to install, but chromebook users, yours falls under Linux.<br>
You can also skip the hassle of downloads by running it in the web with [VSCode Dev](https://vscode.dev/), which runs in your browser, but requires internet.<br>
Feel free to use a different editor, but this guide is not built with them in mind.

# 2. Setting up your workspace
Don't worry, this is the last global step, but install the right extensions. Regardless of what language you're gonna use, install [IntelliCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode) and [it's API](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.intellicode-api-usage-examples).<br>
Additionally, here are some extensions I reccomend for languages covered in this guide:<br>
[Java Extension Pack by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)<br>
[Python Extension by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)<br>
[C/C++ Extension by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack) (Not yet ✨covered✨)
